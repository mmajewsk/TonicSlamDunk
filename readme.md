This is an attempt of creating a guid/script that will show you how to create the environemnt for both orb slam python bindings, but osmap as well.
This relies heavilly on a script found here:

https://gist.github.com/ducha-aiki/2c29cdfd47fa4fe65f1ca083d8f09ef2

Also, Im using my own forks of 

https://github.com/mmajewsk/ORB_SLAM2
https://github.com/mmajewsk/ORB_SLAM2-PythonBindings

**The script is missing installation instructions for protobuff 3.5.1**, so you have to do this on your own.
